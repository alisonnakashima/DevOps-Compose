Compose project.

Getting Started
This project is a starting point for a study case to CI/CD with a Compose application. The main intention here is to learn how to create and configure a CI/CD pipeline.

The tool selected was Github Actions. So, on consequence, there are some configurations on the file CI-CD.yaml on the path .github/workflows.
